# Test

Using Svelte, DiasyUI, Tailwind, which are all already set up and ready to go, please create a page that has a button you can click that calls `eth_requestAccounts` or `enable` on the injected provider (Metamask, etc). Once access has been granted to the provider, then display the current ethereum Block Number, Gas Price, and Chain (Goerli, Mainnet, Ropsten, etc). You can use any library you like for this (Web3, Ethers, etc). Typescript is set up and ready to go as well. Google as much as you need. Please try not to spend more than 1 to 2 hours on this.
